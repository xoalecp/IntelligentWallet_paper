abstract="Artificial intelligence chatbot is a technology that makes interaction between men and machines using natural language possible. From literature of chatbot's keywords/pattern matching techniques, some potential issues for enhancement had been discovered. The discovered issues are in the context of relation between previous and next responses/outputs and also keywords arrangement for matching precedence together with keywords variety for matching flexibility. To encounter these issues, two respective algorithms had been proposed. Those algorithms are Extension and Prerequisite and OMAMC (One-match and All-match Categories). Implemented in SQL-Based chatbot, both algorithms are shown to be enhancing the capability of chatbot's keywords/pattern matching process by providing an augment ways in storing the data and performing the process. This paper will present the significance of results from implementing both proposed algorithms into SQL-Based chatbot that will result on some enhancements in certain area of chatbot's processes.",
